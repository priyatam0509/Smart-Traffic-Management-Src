# Smart Traffic Management System

## We are using a blend of hardware and software to create a fool proof method for management of traffic in cities . We will be having a combination of a WiFi module and an actuator which will communicate directly to the regularly spaced WiFi modules along the road . 
## We majorly will focus on
## A. Precise Queue estimation and alternate route suggestion . 
## B. Using principles of Fluid Dynamics (Continuity equation ) to avoid jams by estimating volume of traffic through a part of the road .
## C. Smart Parking system : A lot of space is misused while parking cars which adds to overall congestion in roads . With the WiFi module built in we will communicate in between cars to suggest the user the best possible place to park his car .
